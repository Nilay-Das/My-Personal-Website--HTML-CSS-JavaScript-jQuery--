# My-Personal-Website--HTML-CSS-JavaScript-jQuery--

The files in this repository contains the project files for my own personal/portfolio website. The website is developed using HTML, JavaScript, jQuery and styled using vanilla CSS. Custom icons have been used in the project. The website is fully responsive and supports all desktop, tablet and mobile phone resolutions. The website is coded in a very simple way and there is room for upgradability. Any changes can be made easily too.
